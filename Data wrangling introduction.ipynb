    "\n",
    "Low quality data is commonly referred to as dirty data. Dirty data has issues with its content.\n",
    "Common data quality issues include :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. missing data, like the missing height value for Juan.\n",
    "2. invalid data, like a cell having an impossible value, e.g., like negative height value for Kwasi. Having \"inches\" and \"centimetres\" in the height entries is technically invalid as well, since the datatype for height becomes a string when those are present. The datatype for height should be integer or float.\n",
    "3. inaccurate data, like Jane actually being 58 inches tall, not 55 inches tall.\n",
    "4. inconsistent data, like using different units for height (inches and centimetres).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality is a perception or an assessment of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context. Unfortunately, that’s a bit of an evasive definition but it gets to something important: there are no hard and fast rules for data quality. One dataset may be high enough quality for one application but not for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Untidy data is commonly referred to as \"messy\" data. Messy data has issues with its structure.\n",

    "Tidy data is a relatively new concept coined by statistician, professor, and all-round data expert [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it’s not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. To get a handle on the problem, this paper focuses on a small, but important, aspect of data cleaning that I call data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.\"\n",
